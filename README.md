# Demographic Data Analyzer
### Python | Pandas | Data Exploration

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I used Python and Pandas to analyze a demographic dataset containing census data. The goal was to extract specific insights regarding education levels, work hours, and income brackets across different nationalities.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow
* **Data Aggregation:** Leveraged **Pandas** to calculate mean, percentages, and counts across various demographic categories.
* **Conditional Filtering:** Applied complex filtering logic to identify specific sub-sections of the population, such as "high-income earners with advanced education".
* **Statistical Insights:** Answered key business-style questions, such as the minimum number of hours a person works per week and the percentage of those who earn >50K.

## 📊 Key Findings
* Identified the country with the highest percentage of people that earn >50K.
* Discovered the correlation between education level (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) and salary expectations.
* Calculated the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

*This project demonstrates my ability to take a "chaotic" raw dataset and provide precise answers to specific demographic questions.*
